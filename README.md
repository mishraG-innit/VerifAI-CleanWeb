# VerifAI — Predictive CleanWeb Network

### 💡 Problem Statement #79: Predictive AI Safety Net for Vulnerable Community Protection

Deepfakes and AI-generated misinformation are eroding trust, dignity, and safety in vulnerable communities.

### ⚠️ Impact Areas
- **Women & Children:** Digital blackmail, AI-fabricated harassment, trauma.
- **NGOs:** Fake donation campaigns and loss of community trust.
- **Society:** Deepfake propaganda and communal tension.

---

## 🎯 Mission

**To create an open, explainable AI safety net that detects, verifies, and acts.**

VerifAI protects users by:
1. Detecting fake or manipulated media using AI.
2. Explaining results through transparent, visual reports.
3. Triggering CleanWeb takedowns after human confirmation.
4. Auto-generating reports for cyber departments and NGOs.

## 📊 Sample Output

```json
{
  "token": "VID-1729150200-FAE91D2A",
  "confidence": 91,
  "status": "Deepfake suspected",
  "risk": "High — Harassment",
  "reason": "Lighting mismatch and facial edge artifacts detected",
  "sha256": "c7e1ab2f9d0e7d8a..."
}
```

## 🌍 Scalability

- API-first structure → can be integrated with NGO dashboards.  
- Browser mode for low-resource communities (works offline).  
- Modular — can plug in stronger deepfake models easily.  
- Open governance — NGOs can fork and adapt locally.
